                    This OER material is intended for use as the first level of web technology development. It focuses
                    on the skills needed to build, maintain, and administrate a website. At the beginning of the
                    courses, students will learn how to construct and test code in different interfaces such as HTML,
                    CSS, and HTML5. After that, the course will teach students how to explore different libraries and
                    frameworks, customize existing routines or procedures in their code, and leverage code from past
                    projects to develop code for a new one. At the end, students will demonstrate their coding skills by
                    translating design requirements and instructions into a responsive implementation using different
                    interfaces and frameworks, and host their class work through the internet.
                    <br><br>
                    The OER material is separated into ten chapters. Each chapter has its learning outcomes, support
                    materials, and some chapters have support videos. The support materials are downloadable and are in
                    .pdf format, therefore before downloading the material you have to ensure that you have an
                    application that can read the .pdf format.

                    The OER material also has activities on HTML and CSS, JavaScript, CSS and JS frameworks, and Python
                    and SQL. The activities are carried out as a complement to the learning of each chapter. Most of the
                    activity have an activity description and an exemplary video.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of the OER website is the projects section. The projects are intended to test how
                    students can link what they learned from the chapters and form a project. Each project has a
                    description of the project, how the project will be graded, and samples of work done by previous
                    students.

                <dd>I want to give my thanks to my mother Wanxia who has taught me to trust in myself, in my abilities,
                    and in my dreams. As my mom says: “always do with the best you can offer!”
                    <br><br>
                    I also want to give thanks to the support of OER in QCC that helped me organize the necessary
                    documentation for the publication of this manual.
